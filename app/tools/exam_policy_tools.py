"""Evaluates an Incomplete_Exam request against the approved incomplete-exam policy
(app/knowledge_base/incomplete_exam_policy.json).

Deliberately narrow scope: this only checks what can be verified from the database
alone -- the submission-window deadline and whether any proof was provided at all.

What it does NOT decide, and why:
- Whether the proof is actually a valid, authenticated medical report, or a genuine
  IT-helpline-verified outage report -- the database only stores free text/a file
  reference in Proof, not a verification status. Deciding "is this proof legitimate"
  from that text is exactly the kind of judgment call that belongs to Gemini (given
  the raw Reason/Proof text plus the policy's stated categories), not something Python
  should fake a verdict on.
- Whether the stated Reason falls into an explicitly invalid category (misread
  schedule, personal travel, standard job obligations). Keyword-matching free text in
  Python is unreliable and risks false positives/negatives. Instead, the raw Reason
  and the policy's list of invalid categories are both included in the evidence
  package, and Gemini -- which is meant to work from exactly this kind of unstructured
  text -- makes that judgment, the same way it currently explains prerequisite/capacity
  evidence in .

Field names below (Missed_Exam_Date, Reason, Proof, Exam_Type, Course_ID, Section_ID,
Term) match the live "Incomplete_Exam" table; Request_Date matches "Request". If
request_tools.py ends up returning a joined dict under different keys, update the
lookups below to match -- the logic itself does not need to change.
